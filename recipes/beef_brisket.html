  <h2>Homemade Suculent Corned Beef Brisket</h2>
  <p>You have never had corned beef like this and if you try it, I truly believe you will never go back to the traditionally 'boiled' beef. This recipe was given to my mother-in-law and it has become a treasured family recipe. The brisket is seared in a hot skillet to give it a caramelized surface when it's done, topped with sliced onions, garlic, and a drizzle of broth, then braised for about 6 hours for a tender, juicy roast. It's so worth the wait! I serve it with colcannon, steamed cabbage wedges, braised carrots, and parsnips. It is our favorite St. Patrick's/Jewish dinner, but we love it so much that I cook it year round.
